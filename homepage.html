This was a project about some collections, the requirements for the page was to make it relatively link to each other, insert table, and have at least 2 divisions and styles, and a css file for all pages. It was challanging for making the page with alot of styles, but I did it:>

	This project was about making a quiz about certain topic and getting a result according to the answers you chose. It required to have at least 6 questions, more than 1 complex CSS function, different outcoms depending on user's score. It was hard printing out the outcomes since there was so so sososooossoo many outcome possible...but we figured it out and made it work.

	<br> <br>
	This is my favoraite project, talking about the places ppl should visit from pacific northwest. The requirements were like at least 3 relatively linked webpages, 2 animations or transitions, images.. The animation part was the most hard part in the project, but in the same time it was really fun.
