<h1>DOG</h1>
<h2>Bichon Friséééééé</h2>


	My favorite animal is dog, especially bichon since i have one in my home. The French word bichon comes from Middle French bichon ('small dog'), a diminutive of Old French biche ('female dog', cognate with English bitch), from Old English bicce, and related to other Germanic words with the same meaning, including Old Norse bikkja, and German Betze. The image below is my dog, Rice.

<h2>About the Breed</h2>


	
The small but sturdy and resilient Bichon Frise stands among the world's great 'personality dogs.'� Since antiquity, these irresistible canine comedians have relied on charm, beauty, and intelligence to weather history's ups and downs. A good-size Bichon will stand a shade under a foot tall at the shoulder. The breed's glory is a white hypoallergenic coat, plush and velvety to the touch, featuring rounded head hair that sets off the large, dark eyes and black leathers of the nose and lips. Bichons are adaptable companions who get on well with other dogs and children. Alert and curious, Bichons make nice little watchdogs'¿but they are lovers, not fighters, and operate under the assumption that there are no strangers, just friends they haven't met yet. Their confidence and size make them ideal city dogs. Bichons train nicely and enjoy performing for their loved ones. Finally, there's the happy-go-lucky Bichon personality that draws smiles and hugs wherever they go.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

The Bichon Frisé is a small dog that weighs approximately 6–11 kilograms (10–20 pounds) and stands 23–30 centimetres (9–12 inches) at the withers, but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breeds do tend to have less curly hair than others. A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body. FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey and brown are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not docked or cropped)
